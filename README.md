# noobcharts
**noobcharts** is chart component on Vue. This library aims to present effective charts without using the Canvas API.

noobcharts originated as a derivative of [vue-slim-stackedbar](https://github.com/che5ya/vue-slim-stackedbar).<br />
Perhaps a standalone npm publish will be done later.
